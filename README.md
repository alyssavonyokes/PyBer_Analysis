## Project Overview

Created a thurough analysis of Pyber's Ride Sharing data. Displayed analysis findings through various charts and tables. 

## Resources

Data Source: 
Software: Python 3.6.1 and Jupyter Notebook

## Project Summary

## Challenge Overview

Create a Pyber Summary table.

- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare per Ride
- Average Fare per Driver

Create a Multiple-Line Plot for the Sum of the Fares for Each City Type.
